University management system

Problem: The manual system is suffering from a series of drawbacks. Since whole of the data is to be maintained with hands the process of keeping and maintaining the information is very tedious and lengthy to workers. It is very time consuming and laborious process because, students need to be visited the universities every month to give the fees and to recieve the slips. For this reason, we have provided features. Present system is partially automated(computerized), existing system is quite laborious as one must enter same information at different places.

Solution: This project system excludes the need of maintaining paper data as all the student records are managed electronically. Administrator doesn't have to keep a manual if the students and teachers. Students dont have to visit to the universities for fees payment. Thus, it saves human efforts and resources.
